# Carbon.ResponsiveImage Package for Neos CMS

This is basically a wrapper for [Sitegeist.Lazybones](https://github.com/sitegeist/Sitegeist.Lazybones). You'll get two Components: [`Carbon.ResponsiveImage:Tag`](Resources/Private/Fusion/Component/Tag.fusion) and [`Carbon.ResponsiveImage:Background`](Resources/Private/Fusion/Component/Tag.fusion)

## Installation

Most of the time you have to make small adjustments to a package (e.g. configuration in `Settings.yaml`). Because of that, it is important to add the corresponding package to the composer from your theme package. Mostly this is the site packages located under `Packages/Sites/`. To install it correctly go to your theme package (e.g.`Packages/Sites/Foo.Bar`) and run following command:

```bash
composer require carbon/responsiveimage --no-update
```

The `--no-update` command prevent the automatic update of the dependencies. After the package was added to your theme `composer.json`, go back to the root of the Neos installation and run `composer update`. Et voil√†! Your desired package is now installed correctly.
